From this day all generations will call me blessed: â€ \\
the Almighty has done great things \textbf{for} me, *\\
and ho\emph{ly} is \textbf{his} Name.

\hl{He has mercy on those who \textbf{fear} him *\\
in every \emph{gen}e\textbf{ra}tion.}

He has shown the strength of \textbf{his} arm, *\\
he has scattered the proud \emph{in} their \textbf{con}ceit.

\hl{He has cast down the mighty from \textbf{their} thrones, *\\
and has lifted \emph{up} the \textbf{low}ly.}

He has filled the hungry with \textbf{good} things, *\\
and the rich he has sent \emph{a}way \textbf{emp}ty.

\hl{He has come to the help of his servant \textbf{Is}rael *\\
for he has remembered his pro\emph{mise} of \textbf{me}rcy,\\
the promise he made to our \textbf{fa}thers, *\\
to Abraham and his chil\emph{dren} for \textbf{ev}er.}
