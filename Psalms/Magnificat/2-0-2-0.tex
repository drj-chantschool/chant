% My + soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, †\\
% my spirit rejoices in God my Savior *\\
% for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.

From this day all generations will call me blessed: †\\
the Almighty has done \textbf{great} things \textbf{for} me, *\\
and \textbf{ho}ly is \textbf{his} Name.

\hl{He has mercy on \textbf{those} who \textbf{fear} him *\\
in every \textbf{gen}e\textbf{ra}tion.}

He has shown the \textbf{strength} of \textbf{his} arm, *\\
he has scattered the \textbf{proud} in their \textbf{con}ceit.

\hl{He has cast down the \textbf{migh}ty from \textbf{their} thrones, *\\
and has lifted \textbf{up} the \textbf{low}ly.}

He has filled the \textbf{hun}gry with \textbf{good} things, *\\
and the rich he has \textbf{sent} away \textbf{emp}ty.

\hl{He has come to the help of his \textbf{ser}vant Is-\textbf{ra}-el *\\
for he has remembered his \textbf{pro}mise of \textbf{me}rcy,\\
the promise he \textbf{made} to our \textbf{fa}thers, *\\
to Abraham and his \textbf{chil}dren for \textbf{ev}er.}
